#10 x 10 Rubik's Cube Emulator

A program which displays a 10x10x10 Rubik's Cube puzzle as a 2D net in a C console window.

##How to Run

Download the file and / or run the code on your IDE of choice (Codeblocks or DevC++ should both work). You should see a 2D net of a Rubik's Cube displayed in a console screen.

##How to Use

To turn layers of the Rubik's Cube, you must first select a direction. The WASD keys select an intuitive direction relative to the "front" face (the one in the middle of the cross) while the Q/E keys select a direction that rotates around the front face. Playing around with it should answer further questions. A set of numbers, 1-9 & 0, will be highlighted based on your selected direction; pressing the key corresponding to any one of those numbers will then turn its respective layer in the highlighted direction. This is a very primitive program so there is no way to reset the cube and scrambling is done by bashing the keyboard for a little while.
